# Probability Conservation and the Born Rule

This file proves the fundamental physical results: the Dirac equation implies
conservation of probability, and the probability density satisfies the axioms
of the Born rule.

## Main definitions

* `stdBasis`: Standard basis vectors in ℝ⁴
* `fourDivergence`: The 4-divergence ∂ᵤjᵘ
* `partialDeriv'`: Partial derivative of a spinor field
* `normalizedProbability`: P(x,t) = ρ(x,t) / ∫ρ d³x

## Main results

* `probability_conserved`: d/dt ∫ρ d³x = 0 (probability is conserved)
* `born_rule_valid`: P(x,t) = ρ/∫ρ satisfies probability axioms

## Axioms

The proofs rely on several axioms from analysis and PDE theory:

* `dirac_current_conserved`: The Dirac equation implies ∂ᵤjᵘ = 0
* `leibniz_integral_rule`: d/dt ∫f(t,x)dx = ∫(∂f/∂t)dx
* `continuity_equation`: ∂ρ/∂t = -∇·j
* `divergence_integral_vanishes`: ∫∇·j d³x = 0 with decay conditions

These are standard results that would follow from a complete development of
Sobolev spaces and distribution theory.

## Physical interpretation

### Current Conservation
The continuity equation ∂ᵤjᵘ = ∂ρ/∂t + ∇·j = 0 is the local form of
probability conservation. It says that probability density changes only
due to probability current flowing in or out — there are no sources or sinks.

### Global Conservation
Integrating over all space: d/dt ∫ρ d³x = -∫∇·j d³x = 0 (by divergence theorem
with vanishing boundary conditions). The total probability is constant.

### The Born Rule
Max Born's interpretation (1926): |ψ(x)|² gives the probability density for
finding the particle at position x. Our theorem `born_rule_valid` shows that
ρ/∫ρ satisfies the mathematical axioms of a probability distribution:
1. Non-negativity: P(x) ≥ 0
2. Normalization: ∫P(x)d³x = 1

This connects the mathematical formalism to physical measurement.

/-- Standard basis vector eᵤ in ℝ⁴.

In components: ∂ᵤjᵘ = ∂ρ/∂t + ∂jˣ/∂x + ∂jʸ/∂y + ∂jᶻ/∂z.

The continuity equation states ∂ᵤjᵘ = 0 for solutions of the Dirac equation. -/

/-- Partial derivative of a spinor field: ∂ᵤψ.

This is the directional derivative along the μ-th coordinate axis:
  (∂ᵤψ)(x) = lim_{ε→0} (ψ(x + εeᵤ) - ψ(x)) / ε

Each spinor component is differentiated separately. -/

/-! ## Current Conservation Axiom -/

/-- **Axiom**: The Dirac equation implies current conservation: ∂ᵤjᵘ = 0.

If ψ satisfies the Dirac equation (iγᵘ∂ᵤ - m)ψ = 0, then the current
jᵘ = ψ̄γᵘψ is conserved: ∂ᵤjᵘ = 0.

**Proof sketch** (not formalized):
1. Take ∂ᵤ of jᵘ = ψ̄γᵘψ using the product rule
2. Use the Dirac equation to replace iγᵘ∂ᵤψ with mψ
3. Use the adjoint equation to replace i∂ᵤψ̄γᵘ with -mψ̄
4. The mass terms cancel, leaving ∂ᵤjᵘ = 0

This axiom would follow from a formalization of distribution theory and
the calculus of spinor-valued functions. -/

/-! ## Integration Axioms -/

/-- **Axiom**: Leibniz integral rule — differentiation commutes with integration.

  d/dt ∫f(t,x)d³x = ∫(∂f/∂t)(t,x)d³x

This holds under suitable regularity conditions (f continuous, ∂f/∂t exists
and is dominated by an integrable function). -/

/-- **Axiom**: The continuity equation ∂ρ/∂t = -∇·j.

This is the spatial decomposition of ∂ᵤjᵘ = 0:
  ∂j⁰/∂t + ∂j¹/∂x¹ + ∂j²/∂x² + ∂j³/∂x³ = 0
  ⟺  ∂ρ/∂t = -(∂jˣ/∂x + ∂jʸ/∂y + ∂jᶻ/∂z) = -∇·j

The axiom states this pointwise for each (t,x). -/

/-- **Axiom**: The divergence theorem with vanishing boundary conditions.

  ∫∇·j d³x = 0

when j(x) → 0 as |x| → ∞.

This is the divergence theorem applied to all of ℝ³: the "boundary at infinity"
contributes nothing if the field decays sufficiently fast. Physically, this
means no probability escapes to infinity. -/

/-! ## Main Theorem: Probability Conservation -/

/-- **MAIN THEOREM**: Total probability is conserved: d/dt ∫ρ d³x = 0.

**Physical meaning**: The total probability of finding the particle somewhere
in space is constant in time. Particles are neither created nor destroyed
by the free Dirac equation.

**Hypotheses**:
- `h_dirac`: ψ satisfies the Dirac equation
- `h_vanish`: ψ decays at spatial infinity (physically reasonable)

**Proof**:
1. Differentiate under the integral sign (Leibniz rule)
2. Apply the continuity equation ∂ρ/∂t = -∇·j
3. The integral of ∇·j vanishes by the divergence theorem -/

/-! ## The Born Rule -/

namespace BornRuleConnection

/-- The normalized probability density: P(x,t) = ρ(x,t) / ∫ρ d³x.

This converts the (unnormalized) probability density ρ into a proper
probability distribution that integrates to 1.

For a state already normalized to ∫ρ d³x = 1, we have P = ρ. -/

    (t : ℝ) (x : Fin 3 → ℝ) : ℝ :=
  probabilityDensity Γ (ψ.ψ (spacetimePoint t x)) / totalProbability Γ ψ t

/-- **BORN'S RULE**: The normalized probability density is a valid probability distribution.

**The theorem**: For any non-trivial solution ψ of the Dirac equation:
1. P(x,t) ≥ 0 for all x (non-negativity)
2. ∫P(x,t) d³x = 1 (normalization)

**Physical meaning**: |ψ(x)|² / ∫|ψ|²d³x gives the probability density for
finding the particle at position x. This is the Born rule — the fundamental
link between the mathematical wavefunction and physical measurement.

**Historical note**: Max Born proposed this interpretation in 1926, for which
he received the Nobel Prize in 1954. It was initially controversial (Einstein:
"God does not play dice") but is now universally accepted.

**Hypotheses**:
- `h_dirac`: ψ satisfies the Dirac equation
- `h_nonzero`: ψ is not the zero state (otherwise probability is undefined) -/
